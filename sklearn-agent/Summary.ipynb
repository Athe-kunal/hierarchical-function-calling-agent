False: metadata is not requested and the meta-estimator will not pass it to split. None: metadata is not requested, and the meta-estimator will raise an error if the user provides it. str: metadata should be passed to the meta-estimator with this given alias instead of the original name. The default (sklearn.utils.metadata_routing.UNCHANGED) retains the\\nexisting request. This allows you to change the request for some\\nparameters and not others. Added in version 1.3.

      "(3, \"The ProbabilityCalibration class in scikit-learn offers the functionality of calibrating classifiers using isotonic regression or logistic regression. It uses cross-validation to estimate classifier parameters and then calibrate the classifier. By default, it fits a copy of the base estimator to a training subset and calibrates it using the testing subset. Predicted probabilities are averaged across individual calibrated classifiers. The calibration method can be 'sigmoid' (Platt's method) or 'isotonic', with the latter not recommended for fewer than 1000 calibration samples due to overfitting tendencies. The class allows for various cross-validation splitting strategies, including default 5-fold cross-validation or custom strategies. The number of jobs to run in parallel can be specified, with the option to use all processors. The calibrator can be fitted using training data and calibrated using testing data for each cross-validation fold, resulting in an ensemble of fitted classifier and calibrator pairs. Alternatively, cross-validation can be used to compute unbiased predictions for calibration. The class also provides methods for fitting the calibrated model, predicting class labels and probabilities, and evaluating accuracy. Metadata routing is available for passing metadata to the fit and score methods. Additionally, the class supports setting and getting parameters for the estimator.\")\n",

The Fit method fits transformer to X and y with optional fit parameters and returns a transformed version of X. The set_output API allows configuring output format for transform and fit_transform, with options like \"default\", \"pandas\", \"polars\", or None. The is_classifier method determines if an estimator is a classifier. \\n\\nThe Mixin class for all bicluster estimators in scikit-learn offers properties like biclusters_, methods to get indices, shape, and submatrix of a bicluster. It provides a convenient way to access row and column indicators together, as well as specific information about biclusters like indices, shape, and submatrix.\\n\\nThe Mixin class for all classifiers defines attributes like _estimator_type and methods like score for calculating mean accuracy on test data. It enforces that fit requires passing y through the requires_y tag. \\n\\nThe Mixin class for all density estimators sets _estimator_type to \"DensityEstimator\" and provides a score method for calculating the model\\'s score on test samples.
